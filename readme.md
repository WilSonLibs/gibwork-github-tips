## Description
Enhancing the Tipping Feature on GibWork

Overview:
In line with GibWork's commitment to continuous improvement and user satisfaction, this pull request proposes enhancements to the tipping feature on our platform. By optimizing the tipping process, we aim to foster a more engaging and rewarding environment for developers contributing to open source projects.

Proposed Changes:

    Introduce Flexible Tipping Options: Expand the current fixed tipping amounts to include customizable options, allowing project owners to specify a range or set their own tipping amount based on the complexity or significance of the contribution.

    Enhance Visibility: Improve the visibility of the tipping feature within the platform interface, ensuring that developers are aware of the opportunity to receive tips for their contributions. This could include prominent placement on project pages or notifications upon successful completion of tasks.

    Implement Tipping Metrics: Introduce metrics to track and display tipping activity, such as the total amount tipped, average tip amount per project, and top tippers. This transparency can incentivize developers to actively participate and showcase the impact of their contributions.

    Enable Anonymous Tipping: Allow project owners and users to tip anonymously if they prefer, enhancing privacy while still acknowledging and rewarding valuable contributions.

Expected Benefits:

    Increased Engagement: By offering customizable tipping options and improving visibility, we anticipate a higher level of engagement from both project owners and developers, leading to more active participation and collaboration within the GibWork community.

    Enhanced Satisfaction: The introduction of tipping metrics and anonymous tipping can contribute to a more transparent and rewarding experience for users, boosting overall satisfaction and retention rates on the platform.

Implementation Plan:

    Research and Design: Conduct user research to gather insights and preferences regarding tipping features. Based on findings, collaborate with the design team to create mockups and prototypes for the proposed changes.

    Development: Implement the new tipping features according to the finalized designs, ensuring compatibility with existing platform functionality and user workflows. Conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve any issues or bugs.

    Rollout and Communication: Communicate the rollout of the enhanced tipping feature to the GibWork community through platform notifications, blog posts, and social media channels. Provide clear instructions and guidelines for users to take advantage of the new features.

    Feedback Collection: Continuously monitor user feedback and analytics to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented changes. Iterate on the feature based on user suggestions and performance data to further optimize the tipping experience.

Conclusion:
By incorporating these enhancements to the tipping feature, GibWork aims to foster a more collaborative and rewarding ecosystem for open source project contributors. We believe that these changes will not only improve user satisfaction but also contribute to the long-term success and sustainability of the platform.

Thank you for considering this proposal. We look forward to your feedback and collaboration in implementing these improvemedirectory

## Github Dependency

The GitHub API imposes a default rate limit of 5000 requests per hour. If the bot 
is set to check notifications every 5 seconds (the default delay), it will operate 
well within this limit. However, setting the delay too short could result in 
exceeding the rate limit.
